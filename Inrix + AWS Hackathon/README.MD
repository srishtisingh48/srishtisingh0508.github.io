AI-Powered System for Optimizing Speed Limits and Congestion

Purpose and Overview:
- Looks at various features (speed limit and average historical speed of road), extracted from the SegmentSpeed Inrix API. 
- Uses a neural network model to calculate the road congestion based on the these two features
- The model allows a city planner to determine the optimal speed limit for the least road congestion.

Methods:
- We first extracted data from the Inrix SegmentSpeed API and created a dataset using the Pandas library. 
- Trained the data on the 20 percent of the data set to fit the model.
- Tested on various speed limits, while keeping historical average constant.
- Analyzed predicted congestion values.
